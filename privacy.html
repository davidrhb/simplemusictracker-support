    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Simple Music Tracker does not collect or transmit any personal data. All information is stored
            locally on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Types Stored</h2>
        <p>The app stores your music tracking data including album titles, artists, listening progress, ratings, and
            notes.
            This data is
            used solely to provide the app's functionality and is never transmitted outside of your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely on your device using iOS's built-in SwiftData framework, which uses local
            storage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
        <p>If you have iCloud enabled, your music tracking data may be synced across your devices through Apple's iCloud
            service. This is handled entirely by Apple and follows Apple's privacy policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your data is retained on your device until you choose to delete it within the app or delete the app entirely.
            No data is stored on external servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Simple Music Tracker does not use any third-party analytics services. For in-app purchases, the app
            uses Apple's StoreKit framework. Purchase transactions are processed by Apple, not by Simple Music Tracker.
        </p>
        <p>When you search for album covers, the app connects directly from your device to Apple's iTunes Search API to
            fetch publicly available album information and artwork. We do not operate servers for this feature, and we
            do not collect or transmit any personal data. Apple may receive your IP address and the search terms
            necessary to return results. Use of this service is subject to Apple's privacy policy. See <a
                href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>
            and <a

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>App Store & Purchases</h2>
        <p>When making in-app purchases, standard App Store policies apply. Your purchase information is handled
            according to Apple's privacy policy, not by Simple Music Tracker directly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app with an updated
            effective date.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the App Store.</p>
